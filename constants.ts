  title: "Part 1: Five-coloured sticky rice",
  description: "Listen to the monologue about five-coloured sticky rice.",
  listeningScript: "Hello everyone. Today I am going to tell you about a special dish from the mountains of Viet Nam. It is called five-coloured sticky rice. This is a well-known traditional dish of ethnic minorities in the northern mountainous regions. As its name suggests, the dish usually has five colours: red, yellow, green, purple, and white. Do you know what they mean? Well, these colours represent the five elements of life. For example, red stands for fire, green stands for plants, and yellow stands for the earth. To make the dish, people do not use chemical colours. Instead, they use natural roots and leaves to dye the rice. This makes the food safe and tasty. People usually make five-coloured sticky rice on special occasions and festivals.",

  description: "Listen to the dialogue about education in 2050.",
  listeningScript: `Interviewer: Welcome back. Today we are discussing education in the future. So, Dr. Phuc, what do you think schools will be like in 2050?
Dr. Phuc: Well, I think there will be huge changes. First, students won't have to carry heavy bags to school anymore.
Interviewer: Really? Why is that?
Dr. Phuc: Because paper textbooks will disappear. They will be replaced by electronic tablets or computers. Students can access all learning materials there.
Interviewer: That sounds convenient. What about teachers? Will robots replace them?
Dr. Phuc: Teachers will still be there, but robots will help teachers explain difficult lessons to students.
Interviewer: Will students study entirely at home?
Dr. Phuc: I don't think so. Students will still go to school to meet friends and develop social skills. They won't just stay at home.`,
